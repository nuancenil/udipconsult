# PTAxial™: Turning Static Patent Data into Dynamic Intelligence

Still struggling with managing complex patent data? Static Excel sheets make visualization difficult, and cross-team collaboration or version control can become time-consuming and inefficient.

### Fully Interactive Table  
Say goodbye to static spreadsheets. Edit patent **titles**, **categories**, **technology tags**, **efficacy tags**, and **notes** directly within the report.  
Experience a true *what-you-see-is-what-you-get* interface — making data organization and updates more intuitive and efficient than ever.

### 2D Analysis Matrix  
A unique matrix that cross-analyzes patent **categories** and **efficacy tags**, visually showing where your technology strengths lie.  
Quickly identify core competencies, technical strengths, and potential white-space opportunities for innovation.

### Innovative Closed-Loop Workflow  
The signature feature of PTAxial is its “semi-open closed-loop cycle,” ensuring continuous productivity and traceability.

1. **Flexible Exporting** — Export selected items for quick sharing, or a complete version for full archival of your edits.  
2. **Smart Re-Rendering** — Upload the exported full version back into the system; it automatically recognizes previously processed data and skips redundant analysis, instantly generating a refreshed report with your latest updates.
